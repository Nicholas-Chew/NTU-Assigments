## Introduction
Inheritance and Polymorphism are 2 important concepts in Object-Oriented Design and Programming.
In this lab, you will get to learn more about the concepts in action. In one the tasks, you will need to
decide whether concrete class, abstract class or interface is appropriate for the task required. In
addition, you will also need to decide on the appropriate ‘is a’ or ‘has a’ relationship
(inheritance/generalization VS delegation/object composition)
