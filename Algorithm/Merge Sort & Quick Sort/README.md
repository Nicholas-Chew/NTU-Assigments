## Introduction
Sorting algorthms are used in the process to solve a a real world problem. For example, the problem can be storing and
searching of employee information based on NRIC numbers, storing and searching of
vehicle information in a taxi company based on car plate registration numbers, storing
and searching of book information in a library, or storing and searching of product
information in a warehouse. If real world data sets are not available, you may generate
synthetic data sets for use in your experiments.
